# TagPole
TagPole is a project born to help people who want to be reminded to do personal activities, like chores at home, by letting them check the done activities by simply scanning an NFC tag with their iphone.

The app present interesting features, like:
• Core Data implementation
• NFC tag writer
• DeepLink handler
• Custom buttons, following our hi-fi prototype done during the design process

It needs few implementations to have the project done 100%
